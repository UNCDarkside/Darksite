        Darkside began in the fall of 1993, when a couple of freshmen at the
        University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill got together with the idea
        of forming an Ultimate Frisbee team. From these humble beginnings, grew
        one of the region’s strongest Ultimate programs. By 1996, Darkside had
        qualified for its first ever UPA Regional tournament. In the spring of
        1999, Darkside qualified for its first ever berth to Nationals. In 2000,
        the team won Sectionals and Regionals on the way to their second
        Nationals bid. With so much interest in the growing sport of ultimate on
        UNC’s campus, Darkside created a B team (B&#8209;atCH) intermittently
        starting in the late 90s. In 2012 B&#8209;ATCH has started their own
        club organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2001, Darkside battled hard and once again qualified for Nationals,
        establishing itself as a perennial Ultimate powerhouse. 2002 was a
        rebuilding year, and despite the efforts of its Callahan Award nominee
        Rhett Nichols and arguably the most talented rookie class in the nation,
        Darkside failed to qualify for Nationals in Spokane, WA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since that time, Darkside has qualified for Regionals six of the past
        eight years, making it to Nationals in both 2005 and 2007. In 2012,
        Darkside started a run of 5 straight nationals appearances taking home
        the National Championship in 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the years following its inaugural championship, Darkside has not only
        returned to Nationals, but has continued to grow its impressive streak
        of 4 consecutive appearances in the national semi-finals, dating back to
        2014.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond these superficial accolades exists a collection of upstanding
        young gentlemen. Darkside is best described as a group of gentlemen
        whose dashing good looks and unflappable southern charm are outweighed
        only by their razor-sharp disc skills, breathtaking athleticism and
        blinding, white-hot competitive fire. More important still, is their
        propensity for camaraderie. Like soldiers headed to war, they must rely
        on each other and trust each other. Being placed in these situations
        creates an environment where a tight-knit sense of brotherhood is not
        just commonplace – it’s inevitable.

      <p>Competitors, teammates, gentlemen, brothers – This is Darkside.</p>
